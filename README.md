REQUIRES A DARKRP DERIVED GAMEMODE!


Originally designed by me for tie fighters in a SWRP server, I've edited it to work for nearly any vehicle and also made this GitHub for it.

Don't let the name and the references to ships and tie fighters throw you off, this does in fact work for most vehicles in GMod, but it's tailored towards those powered by the LFS framework.

This was made for a specific server, as I've said. It may not work on your server or meet your needs, just decided to post it to github in case someone may find it useful :)

Dw about a license, idk just go fuckin ham! anything goes but just make sure to credit me at the very least :)
