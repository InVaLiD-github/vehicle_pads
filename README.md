# vehicle_pads

REQUIRES A DARKRP DERIVED GAMEMODE!

SAVE YOUR PADS IN CONSOLE WITH THE COMMAND 'ipm_save'!

Originally designed by me for tie fighters in a SWRP server, I've edited it to work for nearly any vehicle and also made this GitHub for it.

Don't let the name and the references to ships and tie fighters throw you off, this does in fact work for most vehicles in GMod, but it's tailored towards those powered by the LFS framework.

This was made for a specific server, as I've said. It may not work on your server or meet your needs, just decided to post it to github in case someone may find it useful :)

Dw about a license, idk just go fuckin ham! anything goes but just make sure to credit me at the very least :)

The script supports multiple factions, of which can have specific vehicles per job, that way you can seperate out who can spawn what.

There's a (theoretical) unlimited amount of factions that can be added, so go ham!
